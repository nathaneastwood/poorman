<h2 id="what-is-poorman">What Is {poorman}?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-poorman"></a>
</h2>
<p>{poorman} is a package that unapologetically attempts to recreate the
{dplyr} API in a dependency free way using only {base} R. {poorman} is
still under development and doesn’t have all of {dplyr}’s functionality
but what I would consider the “core” functionality is included. The idea
behind {poorman} is that a user should be able to take their {dplyr}
based script and run it using {poorman} without any hiccups.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="so-what-does-poorman-include">So What Does {poorman} Include?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#so-what-does-poorman-include"></a>
</h2>
<p>A full list of exported functions can be seen on the package website
<a href="https://nathaneastwood.github.io/poorman/reference/index.html" class="external-link">here</a>.
As a brief overview, however, {poorman} includes what is considered as
“core” functionality offered by {dplyr}:</p>
<pre><code>select(), rename(), pull(), relocate(), mutate(), transmute(), arrange()
filter(), slice()
summarise() / summarize()
group_by(), ungroup()</code></pre>
<p>{poorman} also includes the join functionality.</p>
<pre><code>inner_join(), left_join(), right_join(), full_join()
anti_join(), semi_join()</code></pre>
<p>Finally {poorman} includes its own version of the pipe so you do not
need to load or install <code>magrittr</code>.</p>
<pre><code>%&gt;%</code></pre>
<p>More functionality is being developed and will be added in time.</p>

<h2 id="why-develop-poorman">Why Develop {poorman}?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-develop-poorman"></a>
</h2>
<p>This is probably the most common question; why bother developing
{poorman} when {dplyr} already exists? Well there are actually several
reasons why I decided to develop it. The most important reason to me
though is quite simply because I can. {poorman} started out as a
personal challenge and a bit of fun. Also as a freelance R developer, it
is good to build up my portfolio of open source code that I can show to
potential clients.</p>
<p>Another reason for developing {poorman} is I wanted to challenge a
common misconception that {base} R is not as powerful, or as good, or as
useful as {dplyr}. Too often I see and hear comments belittling {base} R
and as a user of the language for over 10 years now - well before the
inception of {dplyr} - I find this idea very worrying. {poorman}’s
package start up message is quite poignant in this regard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d seen my father. He was a poor man, and I watched him do
astonishing things. - Sidney Poitier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One aspect which should not be overlooked is the ability to teach
{base}. Writing {poorman} gives me a platform to hopefully show useRs
two key aspects of R programming in {base}; common data manipulation
tasks; and non-standard evaluation. Going further, this is helped more
by having simpler execution due to the avoidance of C++ code. Of course,
R eventually dispatches to primitive or internal functionality but by
excluding C++ in the {poorman} source, I make the source much easier to
read for useRs who are not used to reading C++ or do not understand it.
This in turn makes debugging and figuring out errors much easier
too.</p>

<h2 id="but-why-not-just-use-dplyr">But Why Not Just Use {dplyr}?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#but-why-not-just-use-dplyr"></a>
</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest, the {tidyverse} is a fantastic set of packages which
have transformed the face of data analysis in R, and {dplyr} is arguably
one of the most important packages within the {tidyverse}. The API is,
in my opinion, very easy to learn and use.</p>
<p>Being a part of the {tidyverse}, however, means that {dplyr} comes
with a large number of dependencies that users must also install which
is often seen as a disadvantage to using the {tidyverse}. Disadvantages
of dependencies have been <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2018/02/28/#017_dependencies" class="external-link">written
about</a> before and so I won’t go into detail here. However what I will
say is that the user may not have a need for additional parts of the
{tidyverse} and so may not wish to have to install multiple packages to
use one or two functions.</p>
<p>Some of these dependencies are very useful of course, allowing
expansion into other areas such as accessing Spark instances and
databases using the same API the user already knows. This is great and
if you are using these additional tools then I absolutely recommend that
you choose {dplyr} over {poorman}. However if you don’t need the extra
dependencies and functionality that comes with the wider {tidyverse}
then maybe consider giving the lightweight {poorman} a go.</p>
<p>Finally a point on installation times, {poorman} takes roughly six
seconds to install. If you’ve ever had to install or upgrade {dplyr} or
the {tidyverse}, you’ll recognise that this is very fast.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="why-the-name-poorman">Why The Name {poorman}?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-the-name-poorman"></a>
</h2>
<p>As I have already mentioned, I have seen comments in the past
pertaining to R’s worthlessness without the {tidyverse} and so the name
{poorman} is a subtle play on the the idea that you must be a “poor man”
if you use {base}. The irony of course is that I have managed to
recreate - quite easily - the key parts of the {dplyr} API using only
{base} R.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-use-data-table-for-the-backend">Why Not Use {data.table} For The Backend?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-not-use-data-table-for-the-backend"></a>
</h2>
<p>Because I wanted to build something that was completely dependency
free and adding {data.table} as an <code>Import</code> adds a
dependency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="but-doesnt-poorman-have-dependencies">But Doesn’t {poorman} Have Dependencies?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#but-doesnt-poorman-have-dependencies"></a>
</h2>
<p>To answer this, we need to define what we mean by “dependency free”.
{poorman} does have some dependencies but they are for development
purposes only and are therefore listed in the <code>Suggests</code> part
of the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file. Thus when a user installs the
package, these dependencies are only ever installed if they are
explicitly requested. However, {poorman} doesn’t have any dependencies
that users of the package need to install in order to use its
functionality. I use these dependency packages to help me develop more
easily. Therefore {poorman} isn’t a truly “dependency free” like
<code>data.table</code> is, but it is dependency free for its intended
users.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="how-does-poorman-compare-in-terms-of-speed">How Does {poorman} Compare In Terms Of Speed?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-does-poorman-compare-in-terms-of-speed"></a>
</h2>
<p>In all honesty, these things don’t interest me. If speed is a genuine
concern for you, you should just consider {data.table}. Benchmarks
comparing {dplyr} and {base} have been done plenty of times before and
{poorman} will have a slight overhead on {base}.</p>
